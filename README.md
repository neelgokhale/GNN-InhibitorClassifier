# GNN for HIV Inhibitor Detection

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the "GNN for HIV Inhibitor Detection" project! In this project, we aim to build a Generative Graph Neural Network (GNN) to detect whether molecular structures are valid inhibitors for HIV virus cells.

## Introduction
In this project, we will implement a generative graph neural network to classify molecules based on their ability to inhibit HIV replication. The project will be divided into several parts, each focusing on different aspects of the GNN implementation and application.

## Dataset
We will be using a dataset obtained from Molecule Net, which contains approximately 40,000 molecules represented as SMILES strings. Each molecule is labeled according to its ability to inhibit HIV replication, resulting in a binary classification task.

## Features
The project will be divided into five parts, each corresponding to a video in the series:

1. **Data Preparation**: Building a custom dataset in PyTorch Geometric, including node and edge feature extraction from molecule descriptions.
2. **Classification Model**: Implementing a simple graph neural network for the classification task.
3. **Generative Model**: Developing a generative graph neural network capable of generating potential HIV inhibitors.
4. **Visualization**: Creating a simple dashboard using Streamlit to visualize results and model performance.
5. **Explainability**: Exploring model explainability techniques using graphs and other methods.


## Usage
Instructions on how to use the project, including code examples and sample commands.
